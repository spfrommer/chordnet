### Setup

1. Make sure you're using Python 3 (preferably 3.7).
2. Install and set up a virtualenv in the harmony directory.
3. Run `./setup.sh`. Make sure that your shell has activated the virtual environment. This should install all dependencies.
4. Extract `misc/data_zips/all_nodrums.zip` and place all the files into the data directory.
5. Run `python train.py` in the chordnet directory.
